# Pharo

This repository contains sources of the [Pharo language](http://pharo.org/). Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).

## Bootstrapping Pharo from sources

To bootstrap a new Pharo image you need the latest stable version of Pharo. For more information about bootstrapping, refer to [guillep/PharoBootstrap](https://github.com/guillep/PharoBootstrap).

The bootstrapping can be done using the following script:

```bash
BUILD_NUMBER=42 BOOTSTRAP_ARCH=32 bash ./bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

This will generate and archive images at various stages of the bootstrap process up to the full image in Pharo7.0-32bit-hhhhhhh.zip where hhhhhhh is the identifying hash.

Additional information on the stages of the bootstrap and how to snapshot during the process are provided as comments in bootstrap.sh.

__Tip:__ You can set `BOOTSTRAP_REPOSITORY` and `BOOTSTRAP_CACHE` environment variables to do the bootstrap outside of the source repository.


## File format

This source code repository is exported in [Tonel format](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/tonel). In this format, packages are represented as directories and each class is inside a single file.
